  * Swift Optional Chaining - process for querying and calling properties, methods, and subscripts on an optional that might currently be nil
  * Optional Chaining as an Alternative to Forced Unwrapping 
  * Research from : [The Swift Programming Language(Optional Chaining)](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/OptionalChaining.html)

* **2015-10-11** - *Day 93*
  * Swift Tuples - Tuples are anonymous structs that can be used in many ways, and one of them is to make returning multiple values from a function much easier.
  * Unnamed Tuples/Named Tuples 
  * Research from : 
  * [The Swift Programming Language(Tuple Type)](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Types.html)

  * [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26773189/why-to-use-tuples-when-we-can-use-array-to-return-multiple-values-in-swift)
 
* **2015-10-12** - *Day 92*
  * Xcode 7 Playground - Import your class into XCODE 7 Playground
  * Try import your custom class to test in playground
  * Resources : With the resource bundle, you can easily add images, sounds, and other data to your playground using the project navigator.
  * Research from : [New Features in Xcode 7](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/WhatsNewXcode/Articles/xcode_7_0.html)

* **2015-10-13** - *Day 91*
